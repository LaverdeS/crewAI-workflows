# AI Crew for Market Analysis
## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the CrewAI framework to automate market analysis. CrewAI orchestrates autonomous AI agents, enabling them to collaborate and execute complex tasks efficiently.

In contrast to the stock analysis agent, the **market analysis agent** takes a broader view, aggregating data across entire sectors, indices, and macroeconomic trends. It examines overall market sentiment, economic indicators, and global events to gauge the health of the market as a whole. This agent is geared toward understanding systemic trends and identifying broader investment opportunities or risks rather than focusing on the minutiae of one company.

Both agents might pull data from similar sources (financial news, market feeds, etc.), but they differ in scope and focusâ€”one is micro (individual stock performance) while the other is macro (overall market trends and sector movements).

## CrewAI Framework
CrewAI is designed to facilitate the collaboration of role-playing AI agents. In this example, The agents work together to build a Python-based game by simulating a collaborative software development process. Each agent has a distinct role, from writing the code to reviewing it for errors and ensuring it meets high-quality standards before final approval.
