# CrewAI Workflows

CrewAI is a Python framework for building and orchestrating autonomous AI agents that work together as a team. It allows developers to define agents with specific roles, goals, and tools, enabling them to collaborate on complex tasks. Agents can research, analyze, generate content, or interact with APIs, following a structured workflow. CrewAI supports sequential or parallel execution, integrates with LangChain and LlamaIndex tools, and provides a YAML-based project structure for easy configuration. Itâ€™s ideal for automating workflows, research, content creation, and more. ðŸš€
